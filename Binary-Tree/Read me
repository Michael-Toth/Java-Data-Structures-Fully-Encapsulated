The exercise asked that we write a program too:

-----------------------------------------

31.  Code an application program that keeps track of student information at your college. Include their names, identification numbers, and grade point averages in a fully encapsulated, homogeneous, linked-based binary search tree. When launched, the user will be presented with the following menu:

Enter:

1 to insert a new student's information,

2 to fetch and output a student's information,

3 to delete a student's information,

4 to update a student's information,

5 to output all the student information in descending order, and

6 to exit the program.
